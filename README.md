#The client here is The Gaming Room a company that was wanting to create a game based on the 1980s television game Win, Lose, or Draw. Requirements provided by the company include the ability for one or more teams to be involved, each team must have multiple players assigned to it, the game and team names must be unique to the teams to checkk is a name is in use when picking their team's name, and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time to be done by creating unique identifiers for each game, team, and player instance. I did particularly well in explaining each independent operating system and considering the needs of the client. I found that having everything written out so that I could go back and review my previous thoughts was extremely helpful when working with a design document. I would probably revise my table and clean it up so it was a little easier to read. I read through the user's needs then compiled similarities and differences in a cloud-based vs traditional OS, this allowed me to make the most educated desicion for the client. I first read through what was required and what would be the most logical use of resources, I will use the design document in the future as it helped to keep my thoughts in order and continue to build ideas that best suited the company.
